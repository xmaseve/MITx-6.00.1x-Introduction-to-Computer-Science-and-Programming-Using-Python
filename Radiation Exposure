    Computes and returns the amount of radiation exposed

    function f (defined for you in the grading script)
    to obtain the value of the function at any point.
 
    start: integer, the time at which exposure begins
    stop: integer, the time at which exposure ends
    step: float, the width of each rectangle. You can assume that
      the step size will always partition the space evenly.
